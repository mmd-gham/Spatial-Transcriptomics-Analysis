# Spatial-Transcriptomics-Analysis
This project analyzes spatial transcriptomic data from human distal lungs using the Scanpy toolkit for cell clustering. High-throughput sequencing and 10x Genomics Visium technology were employed to generate the spatial gene expression profiles. 

The analysis, informed by the research paper "Human distal lung maps and lineage hierarchies reveal a bipotent progenitor" (Nature, 2022), aims to identify distinct cell populations and their spatial organization within the lung tissue, potentially revealing lineage hierarchies and bipotent progenitor cells as described in the linked study. The resulting analysis will provide a detailed map of cell types and their spatial relationships in the human distal lung.
